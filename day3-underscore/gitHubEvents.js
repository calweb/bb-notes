I can add them in next iteration. \r\n\r\nLet me know if I left anything out that you think I should have included. Thanks.\r\n\r\n(@paulirish @Garbee @jaredwilli )",

"body": "I think we all agree that there are some problems with current project architecture:\r\n\r\n- __We need a (better) build task.__ The current code live on html5please.com is totally working, but can be optimised in so many ways. For example:\r\n  * It isn't serving minified html\r\n  * It's not concatenating javascript files together. However, [it should be](https://github.com/h5bp/html5please/blob/master/template.html#L93).\r\n  * It's not serving minified CSS\r\n  * Not huge of a problem, but some files shouldn't end up being online. Our [`.editorconfig`](http://html5please.com/.editorconfig) for example.\r\n\r\n- __We need file watchers.__ Right now, when doing development, you need to run the compass watch task but you also need to run `node ./lib/` every time you change something to the actual content or to `template.html`.\r\n\r\n- __We need some kind of build-in server__ For most of us bumping up a local server isn't difficult, but for others it might not be. I would like to be able to use Livereload too.\r\n\r\n- __Linting__ Right now we aren't using any code linting/formatting which results in mixed tabs and spaces, [missing semicolons](https://github.com/h5bp/html5please/commit/1053c9d46809fb10b28b583debee1d45092b742f), [unnecessary semicolons](https://github.com/h5bp/html5please/commit/4df6084cea166b25d0e7ad8e06c08f940ed1fa23), ...\r\n\r\n- __Autoprefixer__ I would like to include some kind of automatic prefixing, so we don't need to care about things like [this](https://github.com/h5bp/html5please/blob/master/css/sass/style.scss#L8) anymore.\r\n\r\n- __Tests__\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nMy suggestion to handle all of this:\r\n\r\n- Grunt is already included, but we're not using its power. I would like to let grunt/gulp handle the prefixing, linting, server, ...\r\n\r\n- Include a build task, powered by grunt/gulp, doing all the things a good build system does. It would generate a `build/` directory.\r\n\r\n- I would handle the deployment just like the `html5boilerplate.com` repo. Travis runs the build task and puts it into a `server-content`. Than we can let the server periodically pull the new commits in that branch. I don't really know who owns the server used? Is it @paulirish?\r\n\r\n- I would opt to use gulp for all of this (instead of grunt), but of course I'm open for discussion. Also see the discussion in https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/pull/1563.\r\n\r\n- I would be able to handle all of this\r\n\r\n- I would like to replace the logic inside new_feature.sh with node. It's cross platform. (Done in https://github.com/h5bp/html5please/commit/2cead4e0d5cd484e72e29e4dd02909291be775fc)\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nThoughts? \r\n\r\n(I'm just added to the `html5please` team. Hellow!)\r\n\r\n(Cc: @h5bp/html5please)"

"body": "I think we all agree that there are some problems with current project architecture:\r\n\r\n- __We need a (better) build task.__ The current code live on html5please.com is totally working, but can be optimised in so many ways. For example:\r\n  * It isn't serving minified html\r\n  * It's not concatenating javascript files together. However, [it should be](https://github.com/h5bp/html5please/blob/master/template.html#L93).\r\n  * It's not serving minified CSS\r\n  * Not huge of a problem, but some files shouldn't end up being online. Our [`.editorconfig`](http://html5please.com/.editorconfig) for example.\r\n\r\n- __We need file watchers.__ Right now, when doing development, you need to run the compass watch task but you also need to run `node ./lib/` every time you change something to the actual content or to `template.html`.\r\n\r\n- __We need some kind of build-in server__ For most of us bumping up a local server isn't difficult, but for others it might not be. I would like to be able to use Livereload too.\r\n\r\n- __Linting__ Right now we aren't using any code linting/formatting which results in mixed tabs and spaces, [missing semicolons](https://github.com/h5bp/html5please/commit/1053c9d46809fb10b28b583debee1d45092b742f), [unnecessary semicolons](https://github.com/h5bp/html5please/commit/4df6084cea166b25d0e7ad8e06c08f940ed1fa23), ...\r\n\r\n- __Autoprefixer__ I would like to include some kind of automatic prefixing, so we don't need to care about things like [this](https://github.com/h5bp/html5please/blob/master/css/sass/style.scss#L8) anymore.\r\n\r\n- __Tests__\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nMy suggestion to handle all of this:\r\n\r\n- Grunt is already included, but we're not using its power. I would like to let grunt/gulp handle the prefixing, linting, server, ...\r\n\r\n- Include a build task, powered by grunt/gulp, doing all the things a good build system does. It would generate a `build/` directory.\r\n\r\n- I would handle the deployment just like the `html5boilerplate.com` repo. Travis runs the build task and puts it into a `server-content`. Than we can let the server periodically pull the new commits in that branch. I don't really know who owns the server used? Is it @paulirish?\r\n\r\n- I would opt to use gulp for all of this (instead of grunt), but of course I'm open for discussion. Also see the discussion in https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/pull/1563.\r\n\r\n- I would be able to handle all of this\r\n\r\n- I would like to replace the logic inside new_feature.sh with node. It's cross platform. (Done in https://github.com/h5bp/html5please/commit/2cead4e0d5cd484e72e29e4dd02909291be775fc)\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nThoughts? \r\n\r\n(I'm just added to the `html5please` team. Hellow!)\r\n\r\n(Cc: @h5bp/html5please)"

"body": "I think we all agree that there are some problems with current project architecture:\r\n\r\n- __We need a (better) build task.__ The current code live on html5please.com is totally working, but can be optimised in so many ways. For example:\r\n  * It isn't serving minified html\r\n  * It's not concatenating javascript files together. However, [it should be](https://github.com/h5bp/html5please/blob/master/template.html#L93).\r\n  * It's not serving minified CSS\r\n  * Not huge of a problem, but some files shouldn't end up being online. Our [`.editorconfig`](http://html5please.com/.editorconfig) for example.\r\n\r\n- __We need file watchers.__ Right now, when doing development, you need to run the compass watch task but you also need to run `node ./lib/` every time you change something to the actual content or to `template.html`.\r\n\r\n- __We need some kind of build-in server__ For most of us bumping up a local server isn't difficult, but for others it might not be. I would like to be able to use Livereload too.\r\n\r\n- __Linting__ Right now we aren't using any code linting/formatting which results in mixed tabs and spaces, [missing semicolons](https://github.com/h5bp/html5please/commit/1053c9d46809fb10b28b583debee1d45092b742f), [unnecessary semicolons](https://github.com/h5bp/html5please/commit/4df6084cea166b25d0e7ad8e06c08f940ed1fa23), ...\r\n\r\n- __Autoprefixer__ I would like to include some kind of automatic prefixing, so we don't need to care about things like [this](https://github.com/h5bp/html5please/blob/master/css/sass/style.scss#L8) anymore.\r\n\r\n- __Tests__\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nMy suggestion to handle all of this:\r\n\r\n- Grunt is already included, but we're not using its power. I would like to let grunt/gulp handle the prefixing, linting, server, ...\r\n\r\n- Include a build task, powered by grunt/gulp, doing all the things a good build system does. It would generate a `build/` directory.\r\n\r\n- I would handle the deployment just like the `html5boilerplate.com` repo. Travis runs the build task and puts it into a `server-content`. Than we can let the server periodically pull the new commits in that branch. I don't really know who owns the server used? Is it @paulirish?\r\n\r\n- I would opt to use gulp for all of this (instead of grunt), but of course I'm open for discussion. Also see the discussion in https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/pull/1563.\r\n\r\n- I would be able to handle all of this\r\n\r\n- I would like to replace the logic inside new_feature.sh with node. It's cross platform.\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nThoughts? \r\n\r\n(I'm just added to the `html5please` team. Hellow!)\r\n\r\n(Cc: @h5bp/html5please)"
