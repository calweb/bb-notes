## Assignment

Create a simple CRUD application using the object literal pattern demonstrated in the demo today. Please use whatever libraries you want (eg. underscore, jquery, dust).

Also, an open CORS enabled server to store your remote data - you can post,put,delete,get from any domain so be gentle :)
