### Assignment

Add Model Validation to your Model, so that you can catch validation errors:

Requirements:

- your MenuItem Model needs to validate at least 2 properties, using: https://github.com/thedersen/backbone.validation
- Only add model to the DOM if the created MenuItem is valid and saved to the server
- Bonus: have the ability to revert the changes (in the UI) of a MenuItem since the last change event;
