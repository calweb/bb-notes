### Ignoring files with git

If you have not committed anything to the repository, it may be a good idea to start a fresh project with a `.gitignore` file.

To ignore files from being tracked by git, you will need to create a `.gitignore` file.  This file must have a dot in the front of the name as that is what the git version control system expects.  Any files and/or folders will be ignored if they are in this file.

Some Commonly ignored files:
- .DS_Store (folder)
- .idea
- node_modules
- bower_components
